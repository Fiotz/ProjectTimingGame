All gameplay data collected during user testing is collected anonymously. No personally identifiable information is stored at any point during game play sessions. Access to these data files is not publicly open by default, but they may be made available upon reasonable request. Requests mustspecify a valid research or educational purpose, and each case will be individually reviewed to ensure data use aligns with ethical standards and research goals. Currently, the Timing Game application is stored on GitHub, but its access is restricted. Interested researchers may request access by providing a clear justification for its intended use. We plan to make the game available at Google Play Store.This approach aims to balance transparency and reproducibility with ethical responsibility, supporting open science while safeguarding participant anonymity and data integrity.
